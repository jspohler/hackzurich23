H-Store
NewSQL
H-Store was an experimental database management system designed for on-line transaction processing applications.
History
H-Store was originally conceived as the academic prototype. The original version of H-Store was a single-node proof-of-concept used in the 2007 VLDB paper. In the beginning of 2008, researchers at Brown, MIT, and Yale started working on a full-fledged, general purpose H-Store system. At the same time, Horizontica was launched as an secret internal project at Vertica. Once again, these were separate code bases that were to serve separate purposes.
In the spring of 2008, it was decided to merge together the backend execution engine of H-Store and the front-end transaction coordinator and query planner of Horizontica. After the VLDB demo in the fall of 2008, the H-Store codebase was forked off and became VoltDB.
The final version was announced in 2016. There have been no new developments since then. The code

Consistent
Concurrency Control
Deterministic Concurrency Control
Data Model
Relational
Isolation Levels
Serializable
All transactions execute with SERIALIZABLE isolation. It is not possible to execute transactions at a lower isolation level.

Query Execution
Materialized Model
Query Interface
SQL
Stored Procedures
The primary query interface for H-Store was through stored procedures written in Java.
Storage Architecture
In-Memory
Storage Model
N-ary Storage Model (Row/Record)

Stored Procedures
Supported
All transactions are executed as Java-based stored procedures.
System Architecture
Shared-Nothing
